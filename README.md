Pokemon Carmine Red
====================

Introduction
------------
A mod for Pokemon Showdown, specifically the Dragon Heaven server. This mod is based off my Pokemon Red Romhack: "Carmine Red". It aims for a general feel of gen 1 in terms of messed up code, except I buff a lot of weaker mons and provide actual moves to types that only could dream of using stab moves.

I wanted to make a Pet Mod of my romhack so competitive players could have fun with it.


Buffed Pokemon
------------
A lot of pokemon that got the shorter end of the stick have been buffed though several means. Other have been buffed only with the prupose of having similar BST to counterparts.

Out of all the fully evolved pokemon, there's only a single nerf because I wanted to have some pokemon sorted a certain way. Every other have been either buffed or redistributed, and only a handful haven't been touched at all

Almost a third of all the pokemon have undergo some type change. Some of them are for variety, some for flavor, and some because I felt like it. If some of these type changes feel too harsh, consider them like if they were regional variants within the game.

Pretty much all pokemon get STAB moves of their types. And their learnsets are all better overall


Buffed Moves
-------------
A lot of bad/useless moves had been repruposed as completely different moves. Unlike in vanilla gen 1, where types like bug, ghost, and dragon, have no real usable damage-dealing moves, all types now have usable moves.

Some move effects are missing due to their original move have been repruposed. For example the effect of haze no longer exist since is now a different move.

All move effects come from already existing effects within gen 1 code. Some come from unused effects, like 33% of lowering evasion by 1 stage.


Types
------
The type matchup table have been altered a bit. For example, bug now resist Psychic.

Ghost is also a special type, and Dragon is a Physical type


Other
----------
Sleep now last between 2 and 4 turns, instead of 1 to 7 turns

There's a handful of other changes I wanted to implement within my romhack that didn't make the cut, while those would be extremely easy to implement in this showdown mod, I would rather much prefer to keep it accurate to the source material.
